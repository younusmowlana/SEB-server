    /** Used to process a SEB Exam Configuration change that can also effect some
     * running exams that as the specified configuration attached.
     *
     * This deals with the whole functionality the underling data-structure provides. So
     * it assumes a N to M relationship between a SEB Exam Configuration and an Exam even
     * if this may currently not be possible in case of implemented restrictions.
     *
     * First of all a consistency check is applied that checks if there is no running Exam
     * involved that has currently active SEB Client connection. Active SEB Client connections are
     * established connections that are not yet closed and connection attempts that are older the a
     * defined time interval.
     *
     * After this check passed, the system places an update-lock on each Exam that is involved on the
     * data-base level and commit this immediately so that this can prevent new SEB Client connection
     * attempts to be allowed.
     *
     * After placing update-locks the fist check is done again to ensure there where no new SEB Client
     * connection attempts in the meantime. If there where, the procedure will stop and rollback all
     * changes so far.
     *
     * If everything is locked the changes to the SEB Exam Configuration will be saved to the data-base
     * and all involved caches will be flushed to ensure the changed will take effect on next request.
     *
     * The last step is to update the SEB restriction on the LMS for every involved exam if it is running
     * and the feature is switched on. If something goes wrong during the update for an exam here, no
     * rollback of the entire procedure is applied. Instead the error is logged and the update can be
     * later triggered manually by an administrator.
     *
     * If there is any other error during the procedure the changes are rolled back and a force release of
     * the update-locks is applied to ensure all involved Exams are not locked anymore.
     *
